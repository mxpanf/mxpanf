### 👋 Hi there!

I have decided to move all my active development, discussions, and projects to **Codeberg**. This GitHub profile is now **maintained only as a mirror**.

If you want to follow my work, see my latest commits, or contribute to my projects, please join me on Codeberg.

### ⚖️ Why I am Leaving GitHub

My decision to move is based on GitHub’s increasing restrictions, centralized corporate control, and a history of arbitrary repository/account deletions. I believe in a free and independent Open Source ecosystem.

**Key concerns and references:**

* **[Give Up GitHub](https://giveupgithub.org/)** – The Software Freedom Conservancy’s campaign against GitHub’s monopoly.
* **[Arbitrary Account Bans](https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/29/8934694/github-us-trade-sanctions-developers-restricted-crimea-cuba-iran-north-korea-syria)** – Sudden blocking of developers based on geographic location and sanctions without prior notice.
* **[Tornado Cash Takedown](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/wjuhp8/github_has_suspended_tornado_cash_founder_roman/)** – The removal of code and developer accounts regardless of individual conduct.
* **[DMCA & Takedown Policy](https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/github-defies-riaa-takedown-notice-restoring-youtube-dl-and-starting-1m-defense-fund/)** – Concerns regarding how easily repositories (like youtube-dl) can be targeted by corporate entities.
